# React Native G Auth Application


## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```
using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```


## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.


You've successfully run and modified your React Native App.
